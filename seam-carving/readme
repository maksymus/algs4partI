Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height
(or width) at a time. A vertical seam in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottom with one
pixel in each row. (A horizontal seam is a path of pixels connected from the left to the right with one pixel in each
column.) Below left is the original 505-by-287 pixel image; below right is the result after removing 150 vertical seams,
resulting in a 30% narrower image. Unlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (e.g. cropping and scaling),
the most interesting features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image are preserved.
