Write a program to play the word game BoggleÂ®.

The Boggle game. Boggle is a word game designed by Allan Turoff and distributed by Hasbro. It involves a board made
up of 16 cubic dice, where each die has a letter printed on each of its sides. At the beginning of the game, the 16 dice
are shaken and randomly distributed into a 4-by-4 tray, with only the top sides of the dice visible. The players compete
to accumulate points by building valid words out of the dice.
